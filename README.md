# Net-Resource-Collection

Developers and Open Source authors now have a massive amount of services offering free tiers, but it can be hard to find them all in order to make informed decisions.

The scope of this particular list is limited to things infrastructure developers (System Administrator, DevOps Practitioners, etc.) are likely to find useful. We love all the free services out there, but it would be good to keep it on topic. It's a bit of a grey line at times so this is a bit opinionated; do not be offended if I do not accept your contribution.

*NOTE:* This list is only for as-a-Service offerings, not for self-hosted software. For a service to be eligible it has to offer a Free Tier and not just a free trial. If the Free Tier is time bucketed it has to be at least a year.
